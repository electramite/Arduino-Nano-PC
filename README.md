# Arduino-Nano-PC - Upgrade 1.1
Sketches and Schematics for my Arduino Nano PC Project. VGA output and PS/2 keyboard input on a single stand-alone Arduino NANO and just 4 logic ICs.

New and optimized version 1.1 now featuring a full 256 character set in FLASH memory freeing up precious SRAM for your own code.

Have fun!
